The `any` type in TypeScript is a dangerous "escape hatch" from the type system.
Using `any` disables many type checking rules and is generally best used only as a last resort or when prototyping code.

Despite your best intentions, the `any` type can sometimes leak into your codebase.
Assigning an `any` typed value to a variable can be hard to pick up on, particularly if it leaks in from an external library.

This rule disallows assigning `any` to a variable, and assigning `any[]` to an array destructuring.

This rule also compares generic type argument types to ensure you don't pass an unsafe `any` in a generic position to a receiver that's expecting a specific type.
For example, it will error if you assign `Set<any>` to a variable declared as `Set<string>`.

const [x] = [] as any[];
const [x] = [1 as any];
[x] = [1] as [any];

function foo(a = 1 as any) {}
class Foo {
