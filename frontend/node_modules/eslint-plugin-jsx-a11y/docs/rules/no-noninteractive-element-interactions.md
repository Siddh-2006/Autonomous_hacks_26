# jsx-a11y/no-noninteractive-element-interactions

💼 This rule is enabled in the following configs: ☑️ `recommended`, 🔒 `strict`.

<!-- end auto-generated rule header -->

Non-interactive HTML elements and non-interactive ARIA roles indicate _content_ and _containers_ in the user interface. A non-interactive element does not support event handlers (mouse and key handlers). Non-interactive elements include `<main>`, `<area>`, `<h1>` (,`<h2>`, etc), `<p>`, `<img>`, `<li>`, `<ul>` and `<ol>`. Non-interactive [WAI-ARIA roles](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#usage_intro) include `article`, `banner`, `complementary`, `img`, `listitem`, `main`, `region` and `tooltip`.

## How do I resolve this error?

### Case: This element acts like a button, link, menuitem, etc

Move the event handler function to an inner element that is either a semantically interactive element (`<button>`, `<a href>`) or that has an interactive role. This leaves the _content_ or _container_ semantic value of this element intact.

Common interactive roles include:

  1. `button`
  1. `link`
  1. `checkbox`
  1. `menuitem`
  1. `menuitemcheckbox`
  1. `menuitemradio`
  1. `option`
  1. `radio`
  1. `searchbox`
  1. `switch`
  1. `textbox`

Note: Adding a role to your element does **not** add behavior. When a semantic HTML element like `<button>` is used, then it will also respond to Enter key presses when it has focus. The developer is responsible for providing the expected behavior of an element that the role suggests it would have: focusability and key press support.
see [WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices Guide - Design Patterns and Widgets](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/#aria_ex).

### Case: This element is catching bubbled events from elements that it contains

Move the event handler function to an inner element like `<div>` and give that element a role of `presentation`. This leaves the _content_ or _container_ semantic value of this element intact.

```jsx
<div role="article">
  <div
    onClick="onClickHandler"
    onKeyPress={onKeyPressHandler}
    role="presentation">
    {this.props.children}
  </div>
</div>
```

Marking an element with the role `presentation` indicates to assistive technology that this element should be ignored; it exists to support the web application and is not meant for humans to interact with directly.

### Case: This is a heading that expands/collapses content on the package

Headers often double as expand/collapse controls for the content they headline. An accordion component is a common example of this pattern. Rather than assign the interaction handling code to the heading itself, put a button inside the heading instead. This pattern retains the role of the heading and the role of the button.

```jsx
<h3>
  <button onClick={this._expandSection}>News</button>
</h3>
<ul id="articles-list">
  <li>...</li>
</ul>
```

### Case: This element is a table cell

Table cells (and tables in general) are meant to contain data. ARIA provides us with a construct called a [Grid](https://w3c.github.io/aria-practices/#grid) that is essentially a 2 dimensional logical container for content and interactive elements.
